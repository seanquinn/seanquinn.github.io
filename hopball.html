            One of the strengths of the Gaelic Atheltic Association is it's community. Artificial Development started a project that wanted to benefit from the strength of this community. GAA is made up of many clubs spread across Ireland and abroad. Most of these clubs are run by hard working individuals in their respective communities. Each of these clubs have many matches across a season with a large following behind each team.
          </p>
          <p>
            One area where the GAA is lacking though is live updates for club games. So we decided to create something to fill the gap. We created a mobile application that allows fans attending matches to update the score of their local team for others to see. The app was launched in April 2017 and now a community of volunteers has emerged of clubs updating scores on a weekly basis. The app was built to work with iOs and Android and is available on those stores now.
