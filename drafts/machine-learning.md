## Data, Data, Data

> "Data is the new oil"

Data follows us in everything we do. Be that social media, e-mail or the apps we use every day. This data could be pictures of a party you went to, transactions on your bank account or a 5 mile jog while wearing your fitness tracker. In fact, IBM estimates that 2.5 Exabytes (that is 2.5 Quintillion bytes) is generated each and every day.

To retrieve, store and process this data presents many interesting architectural and scalability challenges. However the conversion of this data into actionable information has attracted the most focus.

## Machine Learning 

Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that is heavily draws from related fields such as Statistics and Computational Learning Theory. The aim of Machine Learning is to allow a process to learn a desired task, without following explicit instructions to carry out that task.

The process attempts to learn iteratively through the consumption, evaluation and analysis of large datasets. Much like humans we are constantly absoring new information, and experiencing new things that we will use to uncover new insights.
