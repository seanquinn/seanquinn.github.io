            <h2>A little about Artificial Development</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            Welcome! Let me introduce myself; my name is Sean Quinn and I am the Founder of Artificial Development. I am a graduate of BEng Computer Science in Queen's University Belfast. I started Artificial Development as I believe that many small enterprises can improve efficiency, reduce costs and improve employee throughput simply through the use of custom software. 
          </p>
          <p>
            One word to describe our working process is pragmatic. We want every project to succeed, and for it to succeed it has to meet your expectations. Typically the way software projects start is with a list of requirements and a time scale, and the developers go off and create a product around that. The problem with this approach is that the customer isn't sure of what exactly they want at the start, requirements change, and there is little communication between the two.  Ultimately this ends up with the client being unhappy, the developers having to do extra work and the deadline is not met. We work smarter by working with you!
          </p>
          <p>
            We involve you in every step of the process. From initial requirements gathering until project completion, Artificial Development will frequently connect with you and your users and continually provide you with project updates. We work in sprints, typically lasting two weeks. At the start of each sprint, we will consult you to identify what we should build next for your project. Once a sprint ends, we will show you the results of our hard labour (which your users can try out) and get feedback from you as to whether this meets your requirement. These sprints will repeat until the project is completed. The result of this is that your project is built incrementally, with your feedback to optimise the end product created.
