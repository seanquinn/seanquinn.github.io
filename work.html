          <p>
            One word to describe our working process is pragmatism. We want the project to succeed, and for it to succeed it has to meet your expectations. Typically the way software projects go is a list of requirements is drawn up at the very start of a project, and then the developers go off and create a product around that and come back with a finished product in a length period of time. The problems with this approach is the customer isn't sure of what exactly they want at the start, and the developers base their work off a certain line in a document and nothing else. Ultimately this ends up with the client not being happy, the developers having to do extra work and no one is happy at the end of the project. We work smarter by working with you!
          </p>
          <p>
            We involve you in every step of the process. From initial requirements gathering until project completion, artificialdev will frequently be on your premises talking to you and your users and continually providing you with project updates. We work in sprints, typically lasting two weeks. At the start of each sprint, we will consult you to identify what we should build next for your project. Once the sprint ends (14 days later), we will show you the results of our hard labour (which your users can access and use) and get feedback from you as to whether this meets your requirement. These sprints will repeat until the project is completed. The result of this is that your project is built incrementally, with your feedback to optimise the end product created.
