The Internet is such a powerful medium these days, that it is almost becoming essential for a business to have an online presence. The problem that a lot of people encounter is that they do not know where to begin. There is a lot of terminology thrown around, so much so that it can be off putting to small business owners. 

In this article I will attempt to impart some knowledge for small business owners so that they can make more informed decisions for their needs. There are three essential components you need when starting a website:

	1. An address that it is accessible at a domain, e.g. www.google.com.
	2. Someone to host your website so that it can be accessed via the World Wide Web (a web host).
	3. The actual website files. 

## Domain Names
So you need to get your website up, and you need it to be accessible at a certain address. Then you need a domain name. A domain name is simply the URL address to your website. For example, the domain name for Google is google.com. Typically, a domain name for a small business is the business name. 

Once you have your domain name chosen, you have to register that domain name with a Domain Registrar. Unfortunately, your ideal domain name may not be available if someone else has already registered it.  

In the scenario that someone has already registered it, you can choose another domain name that is available and register that, or if you want, contact the current owner of the domain that you really want, and try to purchase the domain from him/her. Buying domains can get expensive, as essentially it is a piece of Internet real estate.

There are a number of key considerations with domain names:

	* Should I use  .com, .co.uk, .org or another suffix?
	* How long or short should a domain name be?
	* How much does it cost?

### Top-Level Domains
The suffix on the end of a domain is known as a top-level domain (TLD). There are a finite number of top-level domains available which are used for different purposes, below I have listed some common top level domains and their purposes:

	* .com – a commercial business
	* .co.uk – a UK company
	* .org – a non-profit organisation
	* .ie – an Irish domain
	* .ac.uk – an educational institution in the UK

There are many more top-level domains, however it is important that you pick the correct one for your business.  If your commercial business that is targeting primarily a UK market then you may be better off registering a .co.uk top-level domain, or perhaps if you want your business to reach a global market, .com is a better choice. You can register as many domains as you want, so you could in-fact register both a .co.uk and .com address and target the content in each website towards the intended user base. 

## Coming up with the right domain
You want to keep in mind that firstly, your domain name shouldn’t be too long. For example, TerraceFoodAndCoffeeAndClothesCompany.com could become somewhat monotonous for the user to type. That said, you do not want to abbreviate your domain so that it is too short, so much so that the user can not easily see what the website is about from the domain. Worse still, is if you have a domain name that is tough to spell or ambiguous, and leads to users not reaching your website at all. The main guidelines for domain naming is to make it clear, easy to spell and short as possible.

## Registering your domain
Now the important part is to register your domain. This part is pretty simple, you go to a domain registrar, and some good domain registrars are:

	* iwantmyname.com
	* 1and1.com
	* Namecheap.com

Here you enter the domain name that you would like to register. The registrar then checks if the domain is available, and if so you can then choose to purchase it for a specified amount of time. Unregistered domains are not expensive, a typical .com costs around £10-£15 per year.
