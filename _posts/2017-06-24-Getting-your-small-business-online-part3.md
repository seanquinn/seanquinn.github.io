## Customer Engagement

Assuming that you have your website up and running, now you want to drive customer traffic to your website through digital marketing. Digital marketing is a fantastic way of connecting with customers, keeping them aware of the latest offers you have on and helps to build the brand awareness among your customers.  Social media sites in particular such as Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest can drive a lot of traffic to your website.

You should include buttons and feeds that link to your social media presence from your website, to gain more Facebook Likes and Twitter followers. Also, on your social media feeds, you should update customers with links to the latest content on your website. 

## Search Engine Optimisation
If you are looking for something on the web, typically most people go to a website like google.com, bing.com or yahoo.com. These websites are all examples of search engines. The user enters a phrase into the engine, and it returns a list of results ranked across many pages. Ideally, you would like your website to turn up as the first result on page 1 of a search engine result page. However, many other websites are competing for that same spot. 

This is where Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) comes in. The art of search engine optimisation is ensuring that your website appears as far up the page ranking as possible, when certain keyword phrases are searched. When developing keywords for your website, try to research and visualise your customers and what they would be typically searching for. Vague and generic keywords will generally lead to a low search engine page ranking.

## Website Security
A lot of clients ask me for help with regards to keeping their website secure. This often comes back to passwords. When running a website, it is possible that you may have passwords to many different accounts, for example a domain registrar account, a web hosting account, a Facebook and Twitter account, a wix.com account possibly, a database server account and many more. It is paramount that each of these passwords is firstly different from each other, and secondly that they are strong. A strong password typically consists of uppercase and lowercase characters, as well as digits.

If you use the same password in multiple accounts, if any of these accounts are subject to a security breach, then an attacker potentially has your email and password combination. An attacker may try common websites such as wix.com, facebook.com and so on, in the hope of gaining access. Once they have gained access, they may perhaps add inappropriate content, attempt to steal valuable customer information, pretend to act upon the company or add malicious code to your website. 

If you feel that you have been the victim of a security breach, then contact a professional.

## Recommendation
My recommendation for small business owners would be, if you need a basic website in order to have an online presence, then the walk through website builders described previously are quite a good solution. However, if you need a more complex solution that involves integration with other systems, a customizable website and so forth, then contact a professional or a web agency. 

If you opt to go with IT professionals, donâ€™t be put off by the quote that they have given you. I know a lot of clients are usually put off by the seemingly high prices and long waiting times of web agencies. Even though the end product always looks simple, there is a lot of time consuming work that has went in behind the scenes in order to create that perfect website.
