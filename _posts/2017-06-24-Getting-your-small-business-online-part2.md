## Hosting

You have registered your perfect domain, however now you want your website to be accessible at that domain. This is where web hosting comes in. Web hosting is where you pay a company to rent a server so that you can upload websites files that are accessible on the World Wide Web. When choosing a web host, you should take into consideration the type of website you are building. If you are building a small business website then a typical low-cost web hosting package should fit the bill. However, if you want a more advanced website with more storage and features, then perhaps you should call a professional as they will be able to understand what sort of web hosting package you require.

A basic web hosting package costs in and around Â£50 a year. More advanced web hosting packages can incur higher annual fees. Some good web hosting providers are:

	* BlueHost.com
	* DreamHost.com

## Creating your website
You essentially have 2 options: you can hire a website design and development agency that can create a tailored customizable website for your needs. 
Or, given that you just want a simple small business website, there are companies that provide a simple to use interface in getting everything set up for your website. You pick from a predefined set of templates and edit the text and images to suit your business. This solution is definitely cheaper and easier to get started, however you sacrifice the individuality of your website as other websites may have very similar designs. If you choose to avail of this option, I would suggest either using wix.com or weebly.com, as they seem to be the best in the business at time of writing.

### eCommerce
Using the Internet, businesses can avail of a large consumer market. Therefore some businesses may want the ability to start their own online shop. If you are designing a customised solution, then seek help from a professional. Dealing with payments is of critical importance and there are a number of security pitfalls that IT professionals are aware of.

Luckily, shopify.com, wix.com and many others allow you to use their simple interface to setup a predefined eCommerce website to allow you to start selling online.

### Content Management System
Every website owner wants the ability to be able to add and make changes to content on their site. A Content Management System (CMS) provides the ability to control the content on a website. A Content Management System is a tool that allows the website owner to publish, edit and delete content through an easy to use interface. 

If you have opted for a pre-built website, then a content management system is built in. This will allow you to manage certain features about your website, like add and edit blog posts, change the background colour and change images on different pages and so on.

If you have opted for a website design and development agency, a content management system is common practice to be included in all client work and generally allows a great deal of flexibility.
