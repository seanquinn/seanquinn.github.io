> "Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes." - E.W Dijkstra

Computer Science is a fascinating subject that concerns the study of computation. At university I was lucky enough to explore the subject further. 

<!--excerpt-->

During my undergraduate I encountered the subfield of Artificial Intelligence. This topic focuses on the development of intelligent agents. 

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Both Computer Science and AI are relatively new sciences but already has produced inventions that are now an integral part of all of our daily lives. 

Some examples include mobile virtual assistants, image recognition used in applications such as Snapchat, email spam filtering even down to fuzzy logic used to manage washing machine cycles. 

Even though we have many practical applications of AI, there are many unanswered questions within the subject. This has led academics to explore different approaches and goals when creating intelligent agents. Some attempt to create agents that act like humans, behave or act rationally or perhaps think even mimic how we think. This has led to the development of a variety of interesting subfields within AI:

* Expert Systems
* Computer Vision
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Robotics
* Planning and Scheduling
* Cognitive Science
* Machine Learning

As well as attempting to answer interesting theoretical questions, the subject poses ethical problems like *"What decisions should and shouldn't an artificial agent address?"* and *What if computers surpass the abilities of humans?*. 

## A Practical Approach

It is an exciting time to be involved in AI. I have a keen interest in the subject, which is why it will be the main focus of this blog. Even though the extent of my knowledge is just the tip of the iceberg, I hope my readers will find it easy to follow and as interesting as I think it is.

The goals of this blog are two-fold. 

1. Explore the topic of Artificial Intelligence further.
2. Adopt a practical approach to understand topics through examples in Python.

I hope that you find the content of the blog useful and get in touch if you would have any suggestions!
