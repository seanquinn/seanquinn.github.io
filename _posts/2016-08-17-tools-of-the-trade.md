[Python](https://www.python.org/) will be used as the programming language of this blog. Python is a flexible language that makes it a good fit for many artificial intelligence tasks. Some other languages may be employed from time to time (such as Prolog for linguistic processing).

<!--excerpt-->

*If you have never programmed before, Python is one of the easiest and beginner friendly languages to get started with. See Useful Links below.*

## Why Python?

Firstly, I often feel developing in Python is like writing clean pseudo code directly. This is in comparison to other more verbose languages like Java. Python relies on whitespace thus avoiding the use of curly braces and semi-colons. 

#### Hello World in Python
```python
# Python 3.x Hello World
if __name__ == "__main__":
	print("Hello World")
```
#### Hello World in Java
```java
// Java Hello World
public class HelloWorld{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println("Hello World!");
	}
}
```

Python is a general-purpose language and thus is useful in lots of [domains](https://www.python.org/about/apps/). Python is widely used in academia, data science, scripting development as well as web development ([Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) are examples among many others). Thus using Python exposes you to skills that can be transferred to other domains.

Developers in Python also have the flexibility of utilising concepts from functional, object-oriented and procedural programming paradigms. This combined with the fact that the language has a built-in REPL allows for rapid iteration of ideas and prototypes.

However by far the best selling point is the [community](https://www.python.org/community/) that revolves around the language. Firstly, Python is open source and has contributors from all over the world. Users of Python love to work with the language and have in turn created a range of powerful and useful libraries for many fields. This coincides with the 'batteries included' philosophy of the language that provides a range of packages as part of the standard library. 

**Python 3 will be used throughout this blog, as it is the future direction of the language. Specifically I will be using the Python 3.5.2 Interpreter.** 

## Python Libraries

There is a number of incredibly open-source useful libraries in Python that are used regularly. These include:

### [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
The Numpy package provides an n-dimensional array data structure as well as a host of linear algebra functions. 

### [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
The Pandas library also provides additional data structures and functions working with tabular and ordered data. 

### [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)
Interactive shell (IPython) as well as a notebook that displays source code with visualisations.

### [Sci-kit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)
Scientific library providing many useful Machine Learning modules.

### [Keras](https://keras.io/)
A minimalist deep learning library for creating neural networks.

*N.B Easier way of installing these libraries is through Anaconda, a distribution provided by [Continuum Analytics](https://www.continuum.io/). I would recommend taking a look at how to create a conda environment, as well as using pip the Python package manager. A good tutorial can be found [here](https://www.continuum.io/content/conda-data-science).*

## Other Tools 

### [Github](https://www.github.com/seanquinn) 
This website will be used as the host of git repositories for source code and data associated with blog posts.

### [Pycharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
Personally I will be using this Integrated Development Environment by JetBrains. This is just a personal preference, however vim, emacs or a text editor like Notepad or Sublime Text can be used as well.
