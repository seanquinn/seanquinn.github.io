            This project was an internal research effort, that investigated how historical market data could be used to determine future stock prices. Artificial Intelligence was employed through the use of Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. The project was deemed as a success by university professors, and could be used to inform investment decisions in equities. The project is currently in private beta due to the secretive nature of the algorithm.
