Hey!

So a little bit about myself. My name is Sean Quinn and I am a technology enthusiast currently working as a Data Scientist at First Derivatives in Belfast.

I love to build things and have a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This led from my studies of Computer Science (BEng Queen's University Belfast, 2016).

I hope you enjoy the blog and thanks for reading!
